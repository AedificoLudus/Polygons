Time Distribution:

From starting the assignment (Mon 12th March) to Sun 25th March, my time was spent:
4 Days reading assignment specifications. Until I was satisfied I new the assignment properly.
6 Days planning. Pseudocode and structure. (All digital files included, physical planning was largely impermenant so un-includable)
3 Days coding.
Day 1 of coding was structure, Point class and linked list creation.
Day 2 of coding was Polygon class, MyPolygon class and error fixing.
Day 3 of coding was main function, error fixing, mild optimisation and general tidying of code.
Day 4 of coding had a major restructure of the program due to previously unseen segmentation faults caused by logic errors.
Day 5 (overdue) I located several major errors, which while fixing raised segfaults that had not previously been encounters due to logic erros.
  It was decided that the penalty for a late submission was less than the loss of marks due to a segfault.

Inheretance cases:
It would be entirely possible to to create a special class of Polygons which have 4 points which each match one coordinate with two other points. These could use a simplified area calculation.
The increase computational need to locate these polygons on input would make this option non-viable if such shapes were not expected to appear with some level of frequency.
