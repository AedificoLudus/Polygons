Time Distribution:

From starting the assignment (Mon 12th March) to Sun 25th March, my time was spent:
4 Days reading assignment specifications. Until I was satisfied I new the assignment properly.
6 Days planning. Pseudocode and structure. (All digital files included, physical planning was largely impermenant so un-includable)
3 Days coding.

Inheretance cases:
It would be entirely possible to to create a special class of Polygons which have 4 points
